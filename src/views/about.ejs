          <h5 class="card-title">Hi my name is Shinji,</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I have a degree in Electronics Engineering from Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Manila, where I got exposed in latest technologies and trends used in the industry.
            It helped me mold my interests overtime and ended up with the fast emerging world of Softwares! &#128187;</p>
          <p class="card-text">Currently, I work as a full-time Junior Web Developer at <a href="https://ffuf.de/" target="_blank">FFUFM Manila Inc.</a>. Where I help solve problems and develop web applications for our clients. I mainly use Angular framework for front-end applications,
          while also applying the best coding practices and architecture which also helps me deepen and improve my knowledge in Computer Science in general. &#129327;</p>
          <p class="card-text">For the most of the time, I develop small applications just to enchance my skill in development. Aside from using Angular, which by far one of the most popular front-end frameworks to date, I also develop with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Nodejs</a>
          and play different stuff with it like trying out different useful libraries, developing a backend application, and other stuff which I find interesting and useful. &#127776;</p>
